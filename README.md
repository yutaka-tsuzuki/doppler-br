# doppler-br
A Doppler broadening simulator

## What is this?
This set of codes calculate Doppler broadening spectra of semiconductor photon detectors.
It consists of three components as follows.

### `gen_dist_p.py` : A momentum distribution generator
This component generates a momentum distribution of a bound electron with a given set of quantum numbers. 

### `gen_smatrix.py` : An S-matrix and scattering amplitude generator
This component calculates the S-matrix and the Compton scattering amplitude for a given set of initial and final states.
